# AeroStat

### Description

AeroStat is a Microsoft Access-based Airfield Management and Airfield Operations Data Management System. While it's primary function is Air Traffic Logging, there are currently 10 different modules planned for the program.

I rely very heavily on feedback, and GitHub is a fantastic place to centralize, manage, and track various issues and bugs. If there's a bug not mentioned in the issue track, please feel free to open a new issue.

In the meantime, I open and close issues as I go along; trying to keep things as real-time as possible.

## Stations currently using AeroStat:
- 3

## Stations pending deployment
- 6

## Note:
Currently, there is only one person working on the project, currently serving 1.5 locations. It is normal for me to go months as a time without posing it to this GitHub. However, rest assured the project continues and new features are contantly being added.

TL;DR - Low demand = Low GitHub activity
