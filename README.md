# AeroStat

### Description

AeroStat is a Microsoft Access-based Airfield Management and Airfield Operations Data Management System. While it's primary function is Air Traffic Logging, there are currently 10 different modules planned for the program.

I rely very heavily on feedback, and GitHub is a fantastic place to centralize, manage, and track various issues and bugs. If there's a bug not mentioned in the issue track, please feel free to open a new issue.

In the meantime, I open and close issues as I go along; trying to keep things as real-time as possible.
