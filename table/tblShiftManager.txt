A-10 MX TEAM HAS LMR #2
TYPHOON EVAC PARKING PLAN:
8X  KC-135S: PARKING: TAXILANE GOLF NORTH SPOTS: G-14 THROUGH G-21
WITH THE CONDITIONS THAT: 
o	AT THE MINIMUM, THE FIRST TWO KC-135S MUST BRING THEIR OWN TOW BARS. THIS ASSISTS THE TRANSIENT ALERT TOW TEAM IN ACCOMMODATING THE AIRCRAFT AND POSITIONING THEM SAFELY.
o	IN THE EVENT THE TOW BARS ARE NOT BROUGHT, YOKOTA CANNOT SUPPORT THE AIRCRAFT ADEQUATELY FOR MISSION PURPOSES
-	WITHOUT A TOW BAR THE AIRCRAFT WILL HAVE TO PARK ON THE HARDSTANDS, NOSE FACING IN-WARD, AND THE AIRCRAFT WILL NOT BE ABLE TO DEPART YOKOTA WITHOUT A TOW BAR TO BACK THE AIRCRAFT OUT OF THE PARKING LOCATION

o	HOWEVER, BE ADVISED THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE FOUR A-10S ON STATION, LOCATED ON TAXILANE GOLF NORTH SPOTS G14 THROUGH G-17. IN THE EVENT ANY OF THE AIRCRAFT DELAY OR BREAK DUE TO MAINTENANCE; OUR ABILITY TO SUPPORT THE NUMBER OF KC-135S DECREASES. BEST CASE SCENARIO YOKOTA CAN SUPPORT ALL EIGHT AIRCRAFT, WORST CASE SCENARIO YOKOTA WILL BE LIMITED TO SUPPORTING FOUR KC-135S

2X  RC-135S: PARKING: GOLF RAMP
WITH THE CONDITIONS THAT:
o	YOKOTA AIR BASE CAN ONLY SUPPORT THE TWO RC-135S IF KADENA SECURITY FORCES SQUADRON BRINGS ADDITIONAL DEFENDERS.
o	THE 374TH SECURITY FORCES SQUADRON DOESNT HAVE THE MANNING TO PROVIDE THE NECESSARY PROTECTION NEEDED FOR THESE ASSETS. FOR SUPPORTING INFORMATION PLEASE CONTACT MSGT HICKS OR SMSGT ALLEN AT DSN 315-225-7606.
o	ADDITIONALLY THE RC-135S HAVE TO BRING THEIR OWN TOW BAR OR BE ABLE TO USE ONE FROM THE KC-135

2X  E-3: PARKING: CV-1 & CV-2 (BOTH PARKING SPOTS ARE LOCATED WITHIN THE RESTRICTED AREA)
